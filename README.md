# wooc_singlepage_pedigree

This module includes a very nice new "single page" chart. The latest version includes also descendants in the chart.

It is included here as an add-on instead of being part of webtrees standard package because the "single-page" code does not yet conform to webtrees normal coding standards. It doesn't use the usual XML structure, doesn't have a comparable HTML version, and doesn't use the webtrees report framework. The code used to generate the PDF output is hard-coded which will make it difficult to maintain/support.
